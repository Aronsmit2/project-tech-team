- Bars nearby ([Aron](https://github.com/aronsmit2))
- Login with Untappd ([Rick](https://github.com/root-ish))
- Geolocation and code support ([Kris](https://github.com/kriskuiper))
- Make it a PWA, doesn't have to be offline available ([Kris](https://github.com/kriskuiper))
- Liking/disliking other users ([Mark](https://github.com/markschuttehva))
